This project prompts the user with questions, then quickly generates a README.md file based on their input.

When the user calls: 

```
node index.js
```

into their command line on their terminal, they will be prompted with:

- What is your Github username?

- What is your email address?

- What is your project's name?

- Please write a short description of your project.

- What kind of liscense should your project have?

- What command should you run to install dependencies?

- What command should be run to run tests?

- What does the user need to know about using the repo?

- What does the user need to know about contributing to the repo?

The user should be given a `Success!` log and their very own README.md should be generated in the output folder
